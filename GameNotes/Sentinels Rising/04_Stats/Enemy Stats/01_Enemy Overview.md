# Adaptive Strategy
Lieutenants, Commanders, and Generals will have the perceptive ability to observe the players both in and out of combat. Based on how the player regularly plays, the officers will command their units to attack, defend, or retreat in specific ways. If the player usually prefers to fight with melee weapons and abilities, the officers will command their units to be more defensive and fire ranged attacks from afar.

###### Neutral Behavior
This describes the behavior of the enemy when no commands have been given

##### Attack Behavior
This describes the behavior of the enemy when the commanding unit has issued an attack order.

##### Damaged Behavior
This describes the behavior of the enemy when it has taken significant damage and is close to death.

##### Retreat Behavior
This describes the behavior of the enemy when the commanding unit has issued a retreat order.

##### Defensive Behavior
This describes the behavior of the enemy when the commanding unit has issued a defense order.


# Nomadic Nature
Officers will often travel between locations and encourage the units to do the same. This will ensure that there are a wide range of enemies for the player to assimilate at any given time. The enemies will be present in the sections of the world map for a small amount of time before they all move around again. While spontaneous in nature, there are distinct patterns the players will be able to observe if they pay attention for the long run.
# Overshields
Some enemies will have specific overshields around their body to negate a percentage of damage. The players will need to deplete this overshield in order to do damage. The shields can be categorized into 3 different types which are ranged, physical, and energy. Damaging the enemies with the corresponding damage type will deplete the overshield faster.
