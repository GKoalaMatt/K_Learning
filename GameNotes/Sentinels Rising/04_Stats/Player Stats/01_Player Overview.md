# Player Stats
The player has a set of stats that correlate to a number of different systems in the game. The player can modify their base stats through ability ranking, gear, and weapons. 


### Musculature
This stat represents the player's raw physical power and ability to deal devastating melee attacks. A high musculature stat means that the player can hit harder and break through enemy defenses more easily.
### Kinematics
This stat encompasses the player's agility, speed, and jumping ability. A high kinematics stat means the player can quickly maneuver around the battlefield, dodge enemy attacks, and jump to higher platforms with ease. It also represents the player's ability to store and release power for devastating attacks.
### Reconstruction
This stat represents how quickly the player can recover from damage. A high reconstruction stat means the player's health and shield regenerate quickly, allowing them to stay in the fight longer.
### Tenacity
This stat determines how much damage the player can withstand before taking serious harm. A high tenacity stat means the player can absorb more damage and continue fighting, while a low tenacity stat means they must be more careful and strategic in their approach.
### Potential
This stat represents the effectiveness of the player's skills and abilities in dealing damage to enemies. A high potential stat means that the player's abilities are very powerful and can take down enemies quickly, while a low potential stat means that the player will need to rely more on basic attacks to deal damage.
