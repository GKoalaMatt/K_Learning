The players will start from a central HUB in which they can select missions and deploy to certain areas of the overall map.

While the player has the ability to go on missions to specific areas, the entire map will remain open for traversal.

Some areas might be blocked off due to individual player progression in that area.

As players delve deeper into a specific section of the world map, new abilities/suits/features might be unlocked.
