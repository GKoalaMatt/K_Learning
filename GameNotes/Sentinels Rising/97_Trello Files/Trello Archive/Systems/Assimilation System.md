Once select enemies get to a low percentage of health, a visual prompt will notify the player that they can assimilate them.

The player will approach the enemy and go through an animation where they have invincibility frames and absorb the enemy.

Assimilation will only be available for tier 2 enemies.  
Tier 3 enemies will be used to unlock the next levels for the abilities.

The players will only be able to assimilate the matching energy types they are attuned with.

The more you assimilate specific creatures, the more you learn about them. You can learn things like where they will be spawning and habits along with snippets of information.
