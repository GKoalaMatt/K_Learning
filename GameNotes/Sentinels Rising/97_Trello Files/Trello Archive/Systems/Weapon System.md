Weapons have a damage output based off the suits base attributes.

Abilities will use the weapons damage output as part of the formula to calculate damage.

Each weapon will have a melee mode and a ranged mode in order to give players a variety during combat.

Players will be allowed to upgrade their weapons in a similar fashion to monster hunter:

They need to obtain certain mob pieces in order to upgrade the weapons down a certain path, just as in monster hunter.
Certain upgrade paths will give the weapons energy type attributes which can be used to assist in some aspects of combat.
Higher tiered weapons will cause more damage.
Weapons are:

Melee:
Sword Shield
Bladed Tonfa
Meteor Hammer [Whip + Mace]
Cleaver
Spear

Ranged:
Rifle
SMG
Grenade Launcher ( Brute shot )
Sniper ( High Precision/Damage )
Shotgun
