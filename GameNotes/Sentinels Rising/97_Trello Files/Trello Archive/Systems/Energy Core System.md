The energy core system is going the be the players ability to go through a form of metamorphosis and become empowered by a core for a small amount of time.

These ability cores will be available for the players to earn in each section of the game world. To obtain the cores, the player will need to go through challenges set in place by the ancient beings of the planet. Once the challenges are complete, they will earn the core for that section.

Each core has a set of ultimate abilities the players will be able to unleash. Just like when they are able to customize their loadout, they will be able to select with ultimate ability they want, along with which core.
