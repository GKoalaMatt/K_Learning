![[Trello_MobSystem.png|550]]

On each home world there are sectors you can explore and in these sectors are mobs placed throughout the map.

In the area, there will always be 8 LT's, 4 Captains, and 1 General that travel the map with the exception of the general.

You have generic mobs, LT's, CPT's, and Generals.  
The Generals are going to be the last enemy to face in each home world.

Captains are mini-bosses that are required to defeat before facing the general.

Lieutenants are the bread and butter behind how the player progresses and will be highly sought after for assimilation. LT's are going to be hunted in order to draw out Captains; the same can be said for captains being hunted to draw out the general.

The mobs will rotate through each time the player goes into the worlds which means you are never guaranteed the same mob each time.

The way the mobs will be selected is on a random selection with the exception that it is never the same mob twice. The mobs will re-roll once the mission has been completed.

If the player wants to go on an expedition, the mobs will re-roll each time they launch.
