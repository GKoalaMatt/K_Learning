Approved:

-   **Assault Slash** - The player can teleport to other enemies on right clicks and continuously assault targets with left clicks. The player attacks as fast as they click and the percentage of damage from the attacks is cut down to 20% of their normal strikes. This lasts for a small amount of time. The damage percentage, teleport distance, and ability time increase with higher ranks.
-   **Missile Fury** - When the player activates this, a number of tiny missiles will launch from them and trike all enemies within an area around the player. The number of missiles, damage output, and AOE size increases with higher ranks.
-   **Comet** - The player will build up energy then dash in a straight line, damaging any target they come into contact with. The percent of damage and distance traveled will increase with higher ranks.
