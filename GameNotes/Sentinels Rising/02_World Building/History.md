### Dephilia Forms
The planet was formed through the interaction of five massive beings that existed in the early universe. 
These beings were immense and powerful, and they exerted a strong gravitational pull that attracted vast amounts of matter and debris to them. 
Over time, this material coalesced around each of the beings, forming dense spheres of rock, gas, and dust.

As the material around each of the beings grew denser, it began to collapse under its own weight, forming the early stages of planet formation. 
The five beings, now surrounded by their own planets, continued to orbit one another, eventually collapsing together to form a giant superplanet.

Over billions of years, the planet continued to evolve and grow, eventually forming into a stable, hospitable world. 


### Arkai Arise
The Arkai, as they became known, were a highly intelligent and resourceful race who quickly rose to dominance on their planet. They were driven by their innate curiosity and thirst for knowledge, which led them to develop a wide range of techniques for exploiting their world's resources.

One of the key factors in the Arkai's success was their mastery of energy manipulation, which allowed them to harness and control the natural forces of their planet. They built massive structures, such as the temples described earlier, that were designed to channel and focus this energy in ways that enhanced their daily lives and supported their communities.

Over time, the Arkai's cultures evolved, each developing its own unique traditions, art, and architecture. They continued to live by the principles of give and take, and their world was characterized by a deep sense of peace and harmony.


### Temples are Built
In this era, they began to construct massive, elaborate temples across the world. These temples are considered to be marvels of engineering and architecture, displaying their advanced technology and knowledge. They become symbols of  power and influence. As time passes, the temples become central to the Arkai and hold mysteries and secrets that are passed down from generation to generation. The construction of these temples marks a turning point in their history.

The structures within the temples are characterized by intricate, flowing designs that seem to defy the laws of physics. They are made of materials that emit a pulsing, otherworldly energy that can be seen coursing through them like veins. This energy gives the structures and statues an ethereal, almost alive appearance. The walls of the temples are adorned with intricate carvings and sculptures, depicting scenes and figures from their race's history and mythology. At the heart of each temple is a massive statue that represents them, and it is here that the energy is the strongest and most vibrant since they are a direct tap into the massive creatures in the planet.


### Sickness and War
An asteroid lands on the planet, and within it lies a parasitic organism that infects the Arkai. 
The parasite alters the minds of the infected individuals, causing them to believe that the only way to survive is to assimilate others of their kind. This leads to widespread panic and chaos as the infected individuals begin to hunt down and assimilate their uninfected counterparts. The once peaceful and technologically advanced race is torn apart by this internal conflict.

As the infection spreads, entire cities fall under the control of the parasites, and the once proud and magnificent temples become symbols of terror. The uninfected desperately search for a cure or a way to stop the spread of the infection, but their efforts are in vain. The once unified alien race is now fragmented and torn apart, with different factions vying for power and control. The few remaining uninfected are forced to band together to protect themselves and their way of life, as they face an uncertain future in a world overrun by the assimilated. 

The war between the assimilated and the unassimilated is a brutal and intense conflict that rages across the planet. The assimilated, driven by the parasitism that has taken over their minds, relentlessly hunt down and assimilate the uninfected. The uninfected, meanwhile, are desperate to protect themselves and their way of life, and they band together to form resistance movements.

The war between the assimilated and the uninfected takes a dark turn, as the assimilated prove to be too powerful and the uninfected are unable to defeat them. With their world lost, the uninfected are forced to flee their planet and escape into the vastness of space. However, the assimilated will not let them go easily and pursue them, determined to assimilate the remaining uninfected.

This marks the beginning of centuries-long pursuit, as the uninfected and the assimilated race from planet to planet in a desperate bid for survival. The uninfected are constantly on the run, searching for a place to call home and a way to stop the assimilated once and for all. The assimilated, meanwhile, are relentless in their pursuit, always closing in on the uninfected and forcing them to keep moving.

As the centuries pass, the parasite comes into contact with many other species, continuing to spread their parasitism to new worlds. The conflict becomes a story of survival and determination, as both sides struggle to find a way to end the endless pursuit. The uninfected never give up hope of reclaiming their home world, while the assimilated remain determined to assimilate all that they encounter.
