The world is large and mostly land mass. The planet itself has a somewhat hollow mantle.
Most of the structures that are made are built to take in organic signals and function as a living thing. A home could be controlled by the inhabitants so that they can become dense on the outside in cases of extreme weather or even expand to create a heated interior. 

There are massive creatures that lie within the mantle of the planet called [blank]. The [] work together with the many organisms dwelling on the planet in order to sustain each-other. The [] began by allowing their energy to be released throughout all the inorganic material they dwell within and allowing the organisms to manipulate this energy. In return, the same organisms give up a bit of their own in order to keep the [] alive and return this biological information. This exchange is not one of intent but of instincts.

The manner in which the organisms exchange this energy varies throughout all species that live on the planet. Plants will be seen to have a slight pulse run down their stems. Animals would connect through the environment and form small shelters. Enemies such as the infected Arkai are ones that just take and do not willingly return energy back to the [].

There are massive creatures that lie within the mantle of the planet and cover the entirety of it. These creatures send their energy throughout all the inorganic material they dwell within and allow the creatures to manipulate it to suit their needs. In return, when the creatures manipulate the energy, they also return some of their own to the being.
