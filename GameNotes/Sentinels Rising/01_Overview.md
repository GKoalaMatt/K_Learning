This should be the main overview for everything about the game:

Player Goals




## Overview
Sentinels Rising is a 3rd-Person, Hack-and-Slash, Action/Adventure story where the player will engage in action packed combat, learn unique abilities, and go on a journey of personal growth.

The player will have multiple decisions on how they want to engage the enemy, the equipment they use, and strategies to fight with. The player will have customization options to optimize their battle tactics and flow of combat.

## Pillars of Design
Every mechanic, story, and gameplay decision needs to ask the questions, “Does this adhere to any of the design pillars?” and “If the game doesn’t have this feature, would it be the same?”

#### Action Packed
- Real-Time Combat
- Unique Abilities
- Wide Range of Combat Options

#### Growth/Adaptation
- Can absorb and learn abilities through assimilation
- Enemies learn about your strategies and adapt

#### Letting Go
- Story pivots around the main characters' struggle

## **Gameplay loop**
-   Select mission / patrol
-   Configure load out 
-   Start mission
-   Complete/fail mission
-   Restart mission / continue on patrol
-   Back to HUB
-   Complete research / upgrade gear / socialize 


## Milestones
We need for the game to have a good pace so for now we will make the goal for each section to draw out the general.

In order to draw out the general of a section the player will need to complete key missions and then take out each of the commanders in the area.

Generals are the last part of each section and will be a mission based event that can be tackled solo or in a team.

Commanders will be posted at key points of each section of the map and will be actively assaulting important structures or trying to complete particular goals. 

LTs will be roaming with mobs and be another key component to drawing out the commanders and generals.

Wildlife will travel in groups or large monsters and will interact with the patrolling lieutenants. When the enemy forces neutralize these beasts, they will assimilate them and turn them into opposing forces for the player to fight.

### What a Gameplay loop might look like:

### Example 1:

-   Before starting the mission, the player configures their loadout by choosing weapons, equipment, and abilities that they think will be most effective for the task at hand.
-   The player begins the mission and sneaks through enemy lines, taking out guards and avoiding detection.
-   After successfully retrieving the artifact, the player must escape the stronghold before reinforcements arrive.
-   The player successfully escapes and earns a reward of experience points, currency, and a rare piece of equipment.
-   The player decides to return to the HUB to upgrade their gear and socialize with other players.

### Example 2:
-   The player decides to patrol a section of the map to gather resources and complete random encounters.
-   Before starting the patrol, the player configures their loadout with tools and equipment suited for gathering resources and dealing with potential threats.
-   The player encounters various enemies and obstacles while patrolling, such as bandits, traps, and hazardous terrain.
-   After successfully completing several encounters and gathering a good amount of resources, the player is ambushed by a group of heavily armed bandits.
-   The player is overwhelmed and fails the encounter, but decides to retry it.
-   The player tries again and manages to defeat the bandits, earning a reward of currency,

### Example 3:
