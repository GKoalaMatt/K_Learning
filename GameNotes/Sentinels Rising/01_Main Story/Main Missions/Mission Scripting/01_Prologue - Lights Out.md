(When the players start the game the screen will be black and the only things you will hear are large muffled thuds that occur very sparsely between each other. The screen starts to zoom in on this white spot and eventually it grows to be a scene where you see M propped, covered in blood, and sitting against a cave wall. Just to the right of M is a battered and bloody body in similar armor but motionless. The camera steadily zooms in and we can see M struggling to breath and can barely move their arms. Through the struggle we can see the main character get a hold of a gun and through a lot of effort, eventually get it into their mouth. The camera at this point is zoomed to where just the character's upper torso is in the frame, still slowly zooming. As the camera gets to where the gun is just out of frame, a loud POP sounds and just as suddenly the scene changes. The new scene has M and B sitting at what looks to be a food stand in the middle of a futuristic out-doors mall. The skylight is an open view of space. B starts to talk with a bag of freshly popped open chips)

### **B**
Did you know that on Earth they have this thing called a Koala? It's super lazy, eats all day, has a smooth brain which means they are basically dumb and they live in trees for their whole life. 

*(small pause)*

That's kinda like you.

*(The camera rotates over to M giving B a scowl and then back to B)*

It means they are Arboreal….they will spend most of their lives in these trees because they give them food, water and shelter. They will only come down when the tree can no longer provide for them.

*(Brief pause as B eats a chip)*

Think about that……In order to live, you must let go of what has been most comforting to you. It must be nice to feel safe and protected for so long. I don’t think I would ever want to leave the tree in the first place.


### **M**
And that's why we don't eat in public places anymore.

*(The camera rotates similarly to see B giving M the same scowl. In the background you hear numerous people walking, small chatter in the distance and dull lights littering every wall you can see.)*

I think you need to stop listening to those old documentaries. You're just wasting your time learning about a planet that we left behind so long ago. Stop clinging to the past B.


### **B**
All I'm saying is, I need a new tree. This “pledging half our lives” to serve the people and protect our new world thing is getting old. Besides, nothing happens here other than an occasional public outburst or rogue asteroids coming close to orbit. 


### **M**
You almost sound like you want a conflict.


### **B**
At least it would be exciting.

*(They both take a moment to finish up their food)*

Cmon, let's finish up our training for the day, lunch break is ovahhh. Last one there is a rotten Marsupial!

*(B starts to run off down a path, and the player gains control over M.)*

Thats another thing I learned today! They are called Marsupials! 
  

### **M**
HEY, c'mon be careful, there are officials and our supervisors walking these streets, you're going to get us in trouble.

*(M is visibly frustrated at this point)*


### **B**
*(In the distance)*
Yea yea….

Almost there, just a couple more streets.

  
### **M**
*(Under their breath)*
Alright alright.

*(The player catches up with B and they both are standing in front of a fortified door with a scanner attached to it.)*


### **AV 1**
*(An automated voice begins to say)*
Please provide your military identification to access the ICR training room.

*(B provides what looks like an ID card and they are granted access.)*


### **M**
Are you going to take it seriously this time? You always get docked for the smallest mistakes and always let your emotions cloud your judgment.

*(As they get in, the room is split into two sides and a projection of an enemy appears in the room holding a melee weapon.)*


### **B**
*(B mocks M)*
“are YoH GonNA TaKE It SeriousLY ThITH tIme?”  just watch me…

*(B gets a determined face on)*
This one will be my best score yet.

  

### **AV 1**
You are about to begin the Interstellar Combat and Readiness Training Module. You will be assessed on your combat ability in a series of tests that will measure your reaction time, physical power, endurance and ability to adapt. Assume the ready position and take all commands from the prompt.

*(The player will take over control of M at this point)*

Strike the hologram with a series of light attacks.
*(The player will need to complete the full light attack combo)*

Strike the hologram with a series of heavy attacks.
*(The player will need to complete the heavy attack combo)*

Remember that while in combat, you must rely on your adaptability to use these two attacks interchangeably.  
At times, your enemies will use physical force to cause you harm. Use your shield to block the incoming attacks.
*(The player will need to successfully block 3 attacks)*

Holding your defenses for an extended amount of time will drain your suit's capability to apparate your shield. Hold your stance until you have depleted the shield's integrity.
*(The player will need to hold their shield until it depletes)*

You will need to wait until your Combat Suit recovers enough energy for you to use the shield again.
Take this into consideration during combat. While your shield is drained, it is advised to take evasive maneuvers and avoid harm. Evade the incoming attacks in any direction.
*(The player will need to evade 3 attacks)*

At times when physical combat proves to be ineffective, you will need to rely on your firearms to dispatch your enemies from a distance. Switch to your assigned weapon and dispatch the enemies in the distance.
*(The player will need to shoot 3 holograms that have popped up in the distance.*

This concludes the first half of the Interstellar Combat Readiness Training Module. Records indicate that you have a passing aptitude test and do not need to proceed with a new one. If you wish to take a new one, you may begin the aptitude test by stepping through to the qualification course. 
*(A door opens up and the players will have the option to go through a course that measures how well they do in combat, this is not required for them to continue. If the players decide to go through the test, they will be graded on the time it takes them to complete the course. The players will see B standing just outside your training space.)*

  

### **B**
Hey there champ, bet you're dying to know what I got huh?
*(Teasing)*

Well, I aint telling. Once you're done I'll let you know.
*(The player will need to walk over to B and begin talking to them to continue)*

Yea there's no fooling ya…
*(B looks embarrassed)*

I slipped up and got disqualified again.


### **M**
That's what I was talking about, you never take this stuff seriously and one day it's going to come back an….
*(A large thud shakes the ground and makes them both stumble, the lights flicker and quickly all power is shut off.)*

### **B**
Uhh….. M what's going o… 
*(Just a moment later, emergency lights start flashing and a voice is heard blaring over intercoms)*

  
### **AV-2**
ATTENTION THIS IS THE INTERSTELLAR FORCE COMMAND ISSUING A MANDATORY SHELTER IN-PLACE NOTICE. TAKE SELF-PROTECTIVE ACTIONS IMMEDIATELY. GO INSIDE IMMEDIATELY AND STAY INSIDE YOUR HOUSE OR BUILDING.
*(The announcement continues to play over B)*


### **B**
Quick, some people need our help they are running from somethi…..
*(The current announcement gets interrupted and a cryptid interference that sounds alien comes through briefly. It is silent for just a moment then another thud shakes the ground even harder than the first time. You can hear screaming in the distance. A new announcement starts to blare)*

  

### **AV - 2**
ATTENTION, A MANDATORY EVACUATION ORDER HAS BEEN ISSUED. TAKE THE FOLLOWING PROTECTIVE ACTIONS AND LEAVE IMMEDIATELY. GATHER ALL FAMILY MEMBERS. GATHER ALL PETS. GATHER ONLY ESSENTIAL ITEMS. BE SURE TO BRING ESSENTIAL MEDI….
*(The broadcast stops abruptly)*

  

### **M**
WE NEED TO LEAVE NOW!
*(The player will need to run with B and make their way through a series of falling buildings, people screaming for help, and walkways crumbling before them. They eventually come across a small plaza with evacuation pods in the distance. They see unknown alien life-forms walking through the plaza killing off random people. They see one of the last pods shoot out.)*

It's now or never B, we are not surviving if we don't make it out of here. We take those two out and make a break for the escape pods. We don't have much time. ON ME.

*(The player engages in a battle with basic enemies and are doing little to no damage. After some time passes, they will need to disengage the enemies and run to the escape pod. When they do so the next cinematic plays where the player and B get into the pod, a civilian tries to run in but is grabbed and assimilated in front of B and M as the escape pod shoots off and they both walk to the window. They see the space station get smaller as they fly away, revealing an astronomically large unidentified ship that thrusts out large tentacles, completely destroying the station.)*


### **B**
Oh….my…go….
*(The screen goes black and the sound is silent. The title of the game appears on the screen and the opening credits begin.)*
