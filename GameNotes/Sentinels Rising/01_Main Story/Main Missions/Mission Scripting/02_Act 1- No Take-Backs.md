*(The credits end with a smooth transition into  the playable game. The player takes control and can walk down a guided path with some movement options being restricted)*\

### **Lead A**
We are almost there team…..[Insert last name here] I need a rundown….. just want to make sure everyone knows our objective and we don't lose anyone because of a small detail that was left out.


### **S1**
On it….. Listen up, team. Our mission is to gather intel on the enemy's activities in this section of the [color]sector. As you know, the enemy has completely taken over this area and has converged around a strange structure, which seems to be their focal point. They're laying siege to it and we need to find out why.

But that's not all. The enemy is also spreading out from the focal point to capture other important structures within the sector. We can't let that happen. Our job is to infiltrate the area undetected, using the surrounding wildlife and vegetation as cover. We need to get a closer view of everything, gather as much intel as possible, and then rendezvous back to the extraction point.

Time is of the essence. We need to submit our brief by sunset, so we have to move quickly and efficiently. Keep your eyes and ears open, stay alert, and watch each other's backs. We're in hostile territory, and the enemy won't hesitate to take us out if they spot us.

Remember, our success depends on teamwork and discipline. We're the best of the best, and we have a job to do. Let's get it done, people.


### **S2**
Have you seen what they have been doing to some of the wildlife? They like, jump into their skin and then fucking walk around like a little sock puppet. Its fucking gross.


### **Lead A**
They are parasites S2, look at any of the archived footage from earth and you will see the same thing.


### **S2**
Still, it makes my skin crawl.


### **S3**
S2…. People smacking their lips makes your skin crawl….


### **S2**
And It's Disgusting…..

*(The next scene opens up to M and B riding in the back of a vehicle that is also carrying a small number of soldiers. They all sway and as the vehicle hits a number of bumps on the road, you hear someone mumbling under their breath)*

Never let my guard down, Overcome every obstacle, Hone my skills and instincts, Observe the surroundings, Push through the pain, Endure until victory. Never let my guard down, Overcome every obstacle, Hone my skills and instincts, Observe the surroundings, Push through the pain, Endure until….
*(This person is tapping their leg furiously and fiddling with their hands, hunched over with their elbows on their knees.)*


*(Some explosions interrupt the mantra and jostle the rest of the people in the back of the vehicle. Everyone is quiet for a small amount of time until P2 speaks up.)*


### **P2**
Look, I get it….. you're afraid and shit but torturing yourself like that is not going to help….. we are going to go out there…..we are going to die…… that's it….. move on.
*(Looks at wrist communicator)*

5 Minutes everyone.


### **B**
I'm sure if we stick to our training, we should be fine. We can get through this.

*(a large monster rips open the transport, roars inside of it and then throws it. The players go through a flashing)*

  

M and B go on their first mission

-   M watches B take a fatal wound
    
-   M drags B into a cave and we start the opening scene again
    
-   A attaches to M and prevents the suicide attempt
    
-   player passes out
    


Play this when B gets mortally wounded

*(An initial, loud bass-type noise plays in conjunction with the enemies strike, as M watches. A numbing pitch sound plays as if you are hearing the effects of tinnitus and everything else is muffled. Beats similar to that of an irregular heartbeat acts as the base and slows down over time. The high pitched noise continues to grow and crescendo until M is knocked unconscious.)*
