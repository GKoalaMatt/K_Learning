Lieutenants, Commanders, and Generals will have the perceptive ability to observe the players both in and out of combat. Based on how the player regularly plays, the officers will command their units to attack, defend, or retreat in specific ways. If the player usually prefers to fight with melee weapons and abilities, the officers will command their units to be more defensive and fire ranged attacks from afar.

# Nomadic Nature
Officers will often travel between locations and encourage the units to do the same. This will ensure that there are a wide range of enemies for the player to assimilate at any given time. The enemies will be present in the sections of the world map for a small amount of time before they all move around again. While spontaneous in nature, there are distinct patterns the players will be able to observe if they pay attention for the long run.
