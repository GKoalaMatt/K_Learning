During combat, the player can build up a small meter by performing combo attacks, blocking, counters, assimilation and other means. The meter is segmented into a number of slots determined by the players stats and corresponding abilities. When a player wants to activate an ability, they will need to build up enough of the bars segments equal to the ability activation cost. A player can not activate an ability if they do not have enough buildup. The player can not build up the meter any further once they have filled it all the way up.
