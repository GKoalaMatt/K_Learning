Once an enemy has taken enough damage, the player will be able to rush towards and absorb them through a Quick Time Event (QTE). All incoming damage is negated during the assimilation. In order to perform this on normal enemies, they must be at 20% health or lower. In order to perform this on Lieutenants, Captains, and Generals, you will need to deplete their health completely. The rate at which the enemy is assimilated varies.
