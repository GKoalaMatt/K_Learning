If we are going to have some type of "components" that make up our items; and that players will be able to earn back some of those "components" after Deconstructing the weapon, armor, item, etc.
If the player is able to take the "components" (come up with a name for the "currency" that will appear and be spent on these items after deconstruction happens) and create new items, list the quantity of "components" needed to craft that new item.

Esentially, create the blueprint for how deconstructing and constructing and upgrading weapons, items, and armor will be handled.
