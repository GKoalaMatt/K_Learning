When the player is Blocking attacks or holds their shield for an extended amount of time, their shield will deplete. When the player's shield depletes, they will need to wait a certain amount of time until they can use it again. The moment the shield depletes, the player will become stunned and can not react for a brief moment. The shield will slowly regenerate while the player is not using it.
