All characters in the game will be compared to one another through the Threat Level System, (TL/TLS) rather than visually representing numbered levels. The TLS is a means to measure the players overall lethality and combat strength. Each ability will have a certain amount of points that contribute to the players overall TL. Each time a player increases one of their abilities, they increase their TL by a predetermined amount. Each enemy the player encounters will have an indication of their threat level and give the player a slight understanding of what to expect when engaging them.
