Create a folder for each mechanic

(If applicable) Storyboard the mechanic, buttons used, etc.

## Overview
The player will be able to enter and exit this movement mode while Sprinting, using either a controller's LeftTrigger or Shift on the keyboard. In order to initiate the ADS, the player will need to hold down either button for 3 seconds. After the ADS is active, they can release the button, maintaining the ADS mode.


## Initialize
While moving on the ground, getting damaged by heavy attacks, toggling sprint, or moving the LeftThumbstick down and causing the momentum to be lower than [ADS Minimum Speed] will disengage the ADS. While moving in the air, getting damaged by heavy attacks will launch you in a new trajectory based on the impact, simultaneously ending the ADS mode.
